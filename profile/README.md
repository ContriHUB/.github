[ContriHUB](https://github.com/ContriHUB/ContriHUB-23/blob/main/README.md) is an open-source event organized in october, parallel to Hacktoberfest, where we are expecting to get more and more MNNITians involved in Open Source activities.

## What is ContriHUB?

A month long contest starting from October 7th to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). This repo is just the guide to get started on GitHub. We have a lot of different projects coming up. So start contributing and while you are at it, keep checking for more projects as they are added!

Choose any project and start fixing the issues. Every issue you fix will fetch you some points according to the difficulty. There are goodies waiting for you :P. So, Stay tuned and keep checking the repos [here](https://github.com/ContriHUB) for more projects and issues :smiley:
